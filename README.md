# SwingStats
# Golf launch monitor swing stats backed by https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling

- pandas-profiling package source code has been slightly modified for my own purpose

1.) Install package like normal using pip install (SPECIFY v2.8 - see issues in pandas-profile repo)
2.) Find your site-packages folder where pip installs to and find the pandas-profiling folder
3.) See the files I have uploaded in this repo under pandas-profiling to see which files I have altered and replace them accordingly


Note that I have preserved the original pandas-profling package folder structure in my repo. I have also included the original unaltered files in case you'd like to compare and see what I have changed.
